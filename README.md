# Vision-Based Path Tracking Control of a Mobile Robot via Fuzzy Logic 
Vision-based path tracking control of a differential wheeled mobile robot using fuzzy control. A web camera is used to capture images of a path drawn on the floor and a fuzzy control algorithm running on a notebook computer controls the steering and the forward velocity of the mobile robot.
